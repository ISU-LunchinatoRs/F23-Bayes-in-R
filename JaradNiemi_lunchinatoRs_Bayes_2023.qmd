## What is Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics is a coherent framework for learning about the world from
data. 
$$p(\theta|y) \propto p(y|\theta)p(\theta)$$
where

- $p(\theta)$ is your prior (belief)
- $p(y|\theta)$ is the data model
- $p(\theta|y)$ is your posterior (belief)


## STAT 574: Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis

> Probability models and prior distributions; updating priors through the likelihood function. Computational and simulation-based methods for deriving posterior distributions and for estimating parameters. Basic statistical and hierarchical models. Model adequacy and posterior predictive checks. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and introduction to WinBUGS or similar software. Emphasis on applications and examples from the social, biological and physical sciences. 

Prereq: (STAT 301 or STAT 326 or STAT 401 or STAT 587); (STAT 341 or STAT 347 or STAT 447 or STAT 588)

## LearnBayes

```{r binomial-inference}
library("LearnBayes")

# From vignette("BinomialInference")
# Informative prior
# NBA players have three-point percentages between 
beta.par <- beta.select(list(p=0.1, x=0.3), list(p=0.8, x=.4)) 
beta.par # beta parameters

# Bogdan Bogdanovic 2022-23 (from https://www.generatormix.com/current-nba-player-generator)
attempts  <- 360 
successes <- 146

# Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior for Bogdan Bogdanovic
triplot(beta.par, c(successes, attempts - successes))
```

## Binomial model (simpler)

```{r binomial-inference2}
# Posterior using a uniform prior
curve(dbeta(x, 1 + successes, 1 + attempts - successes))

# 95% Credible interval (and confidence interval)
qbeta(c(.025, .975), 1 + successes, 1 + attempts - successes)
```

## Binomial probability comparison

Does adding oxygen in sealed chambers compared to traditional germination boxes increase S. macrostachya germination?
If yes, how much does it increase the probaiblity?
$$Y_i \stackrel{ind}{\sim} Bin(n_i, \theta_i)$$?
for $i=1,2$ (traditional vs oxygen).

Calculate $P(\theta_2 > \theta|y_1,y_2)$:
```{r}
n <- 200; y1 <- 26 + 9; y2 <- 41 + 54 # attempts and successes
theta2 <- rbeta(1e5, 1 + y2, 1 + n - y2)
theta1 <- rbeta(1e5, 1 + y1, 1 + n - y1)

mean(theta2 > theta1)
round(quantile(theta2 - theta1, c(.025,.5,.975)), 2) * 100
```
